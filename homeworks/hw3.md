## Scenario 1: Using a Live Linux Installation
John is fixing Mario’s laptop. He needs to prepare a live USB flash drive that he can boot Linux from so that he can access some important information. The problem is that he only has a 4GB flash drive available. Which Linux distribution would you advise John to use to prepare the live USB installation?

john can use antix linux since its a small size distro. Even though antiX Linux is tiny, it still looks good. Included in the base installation package is the IceWM window manager, which offers a lot in terms of customization.

## Scenario 2: Using Linux for parental control
Mario is concerned about his children using the house computer. He has an older laptop that he has not used in a while and has hired you to prepare that laptop for his children to use. Mario wants the children to use the computer mostly for educational purposes so he asks you to install educational tools in it. He is also concerned about his children using the internet so asks you if you could somehow install a web browser/search engine that has parental control or at least blocks adult content. Mario has given you $150 dollars for upgrades so that if needed you can proceed without contacting him. Which Linux distribution would install in Mario’s older laptop? 

eduubuntu, its the best choice in this situation.

## Scenario 4: Reviving an old PC
Giorgina has an old computer that came with Windows Vista. She cannot afford to buy a new computer or update her current PC. Her computer is used for online shopping, reading emails, paying her bills, and listening to music. All her music is on an external hard drive and she normally does not keep important information on her computer. Georgina is willing to pay you to make her computer faster. You have concluded that installing Linux is the simplest and most cost-efficient way to help her. However, in such an old PC, Ubuntu 20.04 will be almost as slow as Windows 10 so you need to find another distribution that is much lighter on system resources and has been designed for running on older hardware. Which distribution will you install in Georgina’s ~~dinosaur~~ PC?
