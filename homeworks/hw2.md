## Do you agree with Richard Stallman? Do you disagree? Explain your answer.
I agree with the fact that users can control the system or the system controls the user, open-sourced software should be given to the users for free even if the users doesn't know how to program they can pay for some programmers to change the software to make it fit their needs.
