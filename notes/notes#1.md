## The History of GNU/Linux
![gnu](../imgs/notespics/gnulinux.png)
GNU stands for "GNU's Not Unix". It is pronounced as one syllable with a hard g. The word "free" in "free software" pertains to freedom, not price. Once you have the software, you have four specific freedoms in using it. You may or may not pay a price to get free software. Programmers are free to cooperate with each other, and often did in the 1970s. Richard Stallman started his career at MIT in 1971 in a group which used free software exclusively. The project was conceived in 1983 as a way of bringing back the cooperative spirit that prevailed in the computing community in earlier days, Stallman says. It was necessary to have a free operating system, he says, because if there was no free system, users would have to resort to proprietary software.
